Tutorials
*********
We have separated the tutorials into those that relate to *datasets* and those that relate to *projects*.
Throughout the tutorials, we use :class:`user_client <.EncordUserClient>`, :class:`dataset_client <.EncordClientDataset>` and :class:`project_client <.EncordClientProject>` extensively.
We refer to :ref:`authentication:Authentication` page for examples of how to instantiate those.
